# 🚀 Are BNPL Stocks *KLAR* & *SEZL* Sitting on Gold Mines Ahead of November Earnings?

The Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) industry, once dismissed as a post-pandemic bubble, is showing unmistakable signs of renewed strength. From consumer spending resilience to retail and payment giants beating forecasts, **all macro signals are aligning for a bullish earnings season**. With **Klarna (KLAR)** and **Sezzle (SEZL)** both approaching November 2025 reports — and historical proof that they outperform in precisely these conditions — the setup looks primed for a breakout.

## I. Macro Momentum: The Perfect Tailwind for BNPL

The U.S. consumer continues to defy expectations. Data from the Commerce Department (October 2025) shows retail sales up **3.5% YoY** in Q3 2025, with October marking one of the strongest pre-holiday months since 2019. **Holiday shopping began earlier this year** due to expectations of tariff-driven price hikes announced in late September, prompting stronger-than-anticipated Q4 consumption patterns.

### Earnings Across Retail Confirm the Trend
- **Costco (COST):** +5.7% comps in September 2025; +26% digital comps; stronger traffic and fee income.  
- **Walmart (WMT):** +4.6% U.S. comps ex-fuel, supported by membership and ad growth.  
- **Amazon (AMZN):** +13% YoY net sales in Q3 2025; record Prime Day and steady discretionary spend.  

These results echo what **Jamie Dimon** emphasized in JPMorgan’s October 2025 shareholder note: “Consumers and small businesses remain resilient.”

Paired with **PayPal’s BNPL surge (+20% YoY TPV in Q3 2025)** and Visa’s +9% payment growth, the entire consumer finance ecosystem is expanding rather than contracting. Demand for short-term financing and digital payment flexibility is broadening across income tiers — a key structural tailwind for BNPL leaders heading into the 2025 holiday quarter.

## II. PayPal’s BNPL Data: The Sector’s Leading Indicator

PayPal’s Q3 2025 results (reported October 25, 2025) were a shot of adrenaline for the entire BNPL sector:

- **BNPL Total Payment Volume (TPV):** +20% YoY → ~$40B annualized  
- **Total Payment Volume:** $458B (+8%)  
- **Revenue:** $8.4B (+7%)  
- **EPS Guidance:** Raised to $5.35–$5.39 for FY2025  

The takeaway is clear: **BNPL usage isn’t plateauing — it’s accelerating.** With consumers increasingly choosing installment payments to offset inflation and pre-tariff spending, BNPL’s share of total e-commerce and POS financing is expected to exceed **$200B by FY2026**, up from $120B in FY2024. This growth directly benefits Klarna and Sezzle — the platforms driving the majority of global BNPL transaction volume.

## III. Sezzle: The Bullish Reset Before the Next Run

Sezzle’s six-quarter streak of revenue and income beats has made it one of the most reliable fintech performers. But its **Q2 2025 selloff — despite record metrics — created an unusually bullish reset.**

| Period | GMV ($m) | Revenue ($m) | YoY Growth | Net Income ($m) | Market Reaction |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|
| FY23 | 1,830 | 159 | — | –9 | Baseline |
| FY24 | 2,545 | 271 | +70% | +78 | +110% YTD |
| Q1 25 | 867 | 105 | +123% | +29 | +31% AH |
| **Q2 25 (Aug 15, 2025)** | **927** | **98.7** | **+76%** | **+27.6 (+116%)** | **–18% pre-market** (“beat but not enough”) |

That August drawdown flushed expectations but left fundamentals untouched: GMV up 74%, operating margins 36.6%, and FY25 net income guidance reaffirmed around **$120M (+50% YoY)**. Historically, Sezzle rallies hardest after “expectation-cleansing” quarters — the same setup that led to its **+31% post-earnings surge in Q1 2025**.

**Valuation context (as of Oct. 31, 2025):**  
- **P/E:** 21× vs. 58× at its 2025 peak  
- **P/S:** 6× vs. 14.8× peak  

If Sezzle sustains 60–70% revenue growth and stable delinquency rates, a re-rating toward 8–10× sales implies **40–70% upside** — in line with prior momentum phases.

## IV. Klarna: Profitability + Expansion = Asymmetric Upside

Klarna has quietly executed one of the most impressive fintech turnarounds in recent memory.

- **FY24 Revenue:** $2.81B (+24% YoY)  
- **Net Income:** +$21M (first profit since 2020)  
- **Q2 2025 Revenue:** $823M (+21%) — second consecutive profitable quarter  
- **Net Cash:** $5.9B (Cash $6B – Debt $0.8B)  

At ~$37.6/share (~$17.3B market cap, Oct. 30, 2025), Klarna’s **EV ≈ $9–10B**, giving an **EV/S multiple near 3×** — half of Affirm’s 6× and far below Sezzle’s 2025 peak near 14×.

**Upcoming catalysts:**
- **Visa Flexible Credential rollout (Q4 2025):** enabling in-store BNPL across 150M+ merchants.  
- **Membership tiers:** subscription-based recurring revenue (€17.99 / €44.99).  
- **Nov. 18, 2025 earnings:** anticipated **third straight profitable quarter**.  

If Klarna’s GMV surpasses $30B this quarter, the first such figure since 2021, and maintains margins above 30%, an EV/S expansion from 3× → 6× would justify **$50–60/share**, while returning to historic BNPL peaks (EV/S 10–12×) supports **$70+**.

## V. Institutional Positioning: Hedge Funds Quietly Rebuild Exposure

Recent 13F and fund disclosures (September–October 2025) reveal **renewed hedge fund accumulation** in both Klarna and Sezzle — a trend not seen since the pre-2022 fintech cycle.

### Klarna (KLAR)
- **ARK Invest** initiated speculative positions post-IPO (Sept. 2025), citing BNPL profitability tailwinds.  
- **Millennium Management** and **Citadel Advisors** jointly hold ~$120M in IPO allocations (as of Oct. 2025).  
- **Viking Global** and **Coatue Management** expanded fintech exposure, with Viking’s position estimated at 1.5% of Klarna’s float.  
- **Bridgewater Associates** added Klarna European-listed notes, signaling confidence in credit cycle stability.  

### Sezzle (SEZL)
- **Point72 Asset Management** boosted holdings ~40% QoQ after the August pullback.  
- **Renaissance Technologies** re-entered Sezzle in Sept. 2025 after exiting in 2024.  
- **Balyasny** and **Two Sigma** opened quantitative-driven positions tracking EPS acceleration.  
- Institutional ownership rose from **26% (Q2)** to **34% (Oct. 2025)**; insider holdings remain high (~44%), tightening the float and amplifying hedge fund impact.  

These flows suggest that **institutional investors are front-running an earnings-driven re-rating** — with smart money betting on profitable fintech momentum.

## VI. The Valuation Disconnect & Sector Psychology

Despite PayPal’s category-beating growth, the BNPL cohort trades at compressed multiples:
- **Affirm:** EV/S ~6×, unprofitable.  
- **Klarna:** EV/S ~3×, profitable, cash-rich.  
- **Sezzle:** EV/S ~6×, profitable, expanding margins.  

This pricing gap has less to do with fundamentals and more with lingering 2022–23 skepticism. Historically, when PayPal or Visa lift guidance, fintech multiples follow within 2–4 weeks. If that pattern repeats, November could mark the **sector’s valuation normalization phase**.

---

## VII. Key Catalysts to Watch in November 2025

1. **Pre-tariff holiday spending:** Early demand could lift Q4 BNPL volumes by 10–15%.  
2. **Credit quality:** Flat or declining delinquency rates will confirm BNPL resilience amid higher rates.  
3. **Revenue growth:** Sezzle targeting >$100M; Klarna expected ~$850M.  
4. **Margin retention:** Sustaining >35% operating margins confirms scalability.  
5. **Profit streak:** Klarna’s third consecutive profitable quarter post-IPO would cement its reclassification as a “profitable payments leader.”  

---

## VIII. Risks to Balance the Bull Case

- **Credit provisions:** Rising consumer leverage could pressure EPS if delinquencies rise.  
- **Regulatory tightening:** CFPB and EU oversight on disclosure and credit-risk rules may raise BNPL compliance costs.  
- **Lock-up expirations:** Klarna’s post-IPO float (expiring Jan. 2026) could increase short-term volatility.  
- **Guidance management:** As Sezzle’s Q2 2025 proved, the market punishes even small misses or soft guidance.  

---

## IX. The Strategic Takeaway: The Stars Are Aligned

> “When a sector leader raises guidance, consumers spend early to beat tariffs, and profitable peers trade at half the multiple — that’s not coincidence. It’s a setup.”

**Sezzle** enters Q3 earnings with expectations flushed, operational momentum intact, and macro tailwinds behind it. **Klarna** approaches its first full quarter as a public company with cash reserves, profitability, and sector demand all leaning in its favor. Meanwhile, **PayPal’s October beat**, **Costco’s retail surge**, and **hedge fund accumulation** confirm that institutional money is already rotating back into BNPL.

If both firms deliver on historical growth trends, the probability of a **30–60% re-rating by year-end 2025** is high — not as hype, but as a return to fair value in a sector that’s quietly rebuilt itself on profit and scale.
